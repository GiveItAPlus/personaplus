## Give yourself a plus!

**PersonaPlus** is a free and open source Android app to help you create healthy routines & habits, so you give yourself a better life, or "_give yourself a plus_" as we like to say.

### Download the app

> [!CAUTION]
> Note that as the app is still a work in progress, we may change how data is stored from update to update, making you **loose your data** from one release to another. Don't use (just yet :wink:) PersonaPlus as your daily companion app.

PersonaPlus is still under early development. You can try out the app downloading a pre-release version from the [releases page](https://github.com/GiveItAPlus/personaplus/releases). **No version is stable / finished**, so expect issues & missing features. As an early app, we kindly ask you to [report here any issue you find](https://github.com/GiveItAPlus/personaplus/issues). Thank you!

PersonaPlus' interface is available in English and Spanish.

## Planned features, roadmap, and more

Many features we promised are in development and either:

- Not available at all.
- Hidden behind the "Experiments" tab on the app's settings.
- Available, but with limited functionality or known bugs.

You can see everything that's planned on our [TODO.md](https://github.com/GiveItAPlus/personaplus/blob/main/TODO.md) file. For important features / updates, you can see our progress on them via our tracking issues ([the ones labeled as "Roadmap" issues](https://github.com/GiveItAPlus/personaplus/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Aroadmap)).
